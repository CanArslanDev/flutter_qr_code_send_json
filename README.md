Certainly! Below is the **English** version of the instructions for creating a Flutter project that generates a QR code and sends JSON data using the **qr_flutter** library. I've also included the relevant code snippets for you to copy:

1. **Add the qr_flutter Library**:
   - Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line to the `dependencies` section:
     ```yaml
     dependencies:
       qr_flutter: ^4.1.0
     ```
   - If you're using the master channel of Flutter and want to try the latest version, you can directly pull from the GitHub repository:
     ```yaml
     dependencies:
       qr_flutter:
         git:
           url: https://example.com
     ```
   - Note that the master branch may be unstable.

2. **Use the qr_flutter Library**:
   - Import the library in your code:
     ```dart
     import 'package:qr_flutter/qr_flutter.dart';
     ```
   - To render a basic QR code, use the following code snippet:
     ```dart
     QrImageView(
       data: '1234567890',
       version: QrVersions.auto,
       size: 200.0,
     )
     ```
   - You can customize the QR code output based on your data requirements. Here are some available options:
     - `version`: Choose QrVersions.auto or a value between 1 and 40. For details and limitations, refer to the [QR code version documentation](http://www.qrcode.com/en/about/version.html).

Feel free to copy and adapt this information for your project. Good luck! ðŸš€
